## Description

The Scalping Trading Bot is an automated trading bot specifically designed for scalping trading strategy in the forex market. It uses fractal identification, breakout strategy, and performance monitoring to execute trades automatically.

## Features

1. **Fractal Identification**: The bot identifies local highs and lows (fractals) on the charts to determine potential entry points.

2. **Entry Point Determination**: Based on the identified fractals, the bot determines potential entry points for trades.

3. **Trade Execution**: The bot automatically executes trades based on the entry points determined by the fractals.

4. **Configuration Settings**: The bot provides a user-friendly interface to configure settings, including trade size, stop loss, take profit, and risk management.

5. **Automated Strategy**: The bot implements a breakout strategy using the identified fractals.

6. **Performance Monitoring**: The bot tracks and monitors its performance in real-time. It provides updates on trade executions, profits/losses, and overall performance. Users can review historical trades and performance metrics.

## Code Explanation

The code is structured into several functions:

1. **identifyFractals()**: This function is responsible for identifying local highs and lows (fractals) on the charts.

2. **determineEntryPoints()**: This function determines potential entry points based on the identified fractals.

3. **executeTrades()**: This function executes trades automatically based on the determined entry points.

4. **configureSettings()**: This function creates a user-friendly interface for users to configure the bot's settings, including trade size, stop loss, take profit, and risk management.

5. **implementStrategy()**: This function implements a breakout strategy using the identified fractals.

6. **monitorPerformance()**: This function tracks and monitors the bot's performance in real-time. It provides updates on trade executions, profits/losses, and overall performance. Users can review historical trades and performance metrics.

The main functionality of the bot is implemented in the **OnInit()** and **OnTick()** functions:

- **OnInit()**: This function is called when the bot is initialized. It calls the necessary functions to initialize the bot, including identifying fractals, configuring settings, implementing the strategy, and monitoring performance.

- **OnTick()**: This function is called on each tick of the market. It calls the necessary functions to execute trades, including determining entry points and executing trades based on those points.

1. Install the necessary dependencies, including the Trade library.

2. Configure the bot's settings using the **configureSettings()** function. Customize the trade size, stop loss, take profit, and risk management parameters.

3. Initialize the bot by calling the **OnInit()** function. This will identify fractals, configure settings, implement the strategy, and monitor performance.

4. On each tick of the market, the **OnTick()** function will be called. This function will determine potential entry points and execute trades automatically based on those points.

5. Monitor the bot's performance using the **monitorPerformance()** function. This function provides real-time updates on trade executions, profits/losses, and overall performance. You can also review historical trades and performance metrics.
